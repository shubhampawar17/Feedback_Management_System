# Feedback_Management_System

The Feedback Management System is a web-based application designed to facilitate the collection and management of feedback within an educational or organizational setting. The system has two main user roles: **Student** and **Admin**. Key features of the system include:

1. **Student Feedback Submission**:  
   Students are required to provide feedback by entering their **name**, **email address**, a **written feedback** message, and a **rating** (out of 5). After filling out the feedback form, students can submit their responses, which are then stored in the system for review by the admin.

2. **Admin Dashboard**:  
   The admin has access to a dashboard where they can perform the following functions:
   - **View Feedback**: The admin can browse all submitted feedback, which is displayed in an organized manner, including the student's name, email, written feedback, and rating.
   - **Delete Feedback**: The admin has the authority to delete any feedback from the system if deemed necessary, ensuring that only relevant and constructive feedback is maintained.
   - **Log Out**: Once the admin has completed the necessary tasks, they can securely log out of the system to end the session.

This Feedback Management System is designed to streamline the process of collecting and managing feedback, ensuring that student opinions are gathered efficiently while giving administrators the tools to manage and review feedback effectively.
